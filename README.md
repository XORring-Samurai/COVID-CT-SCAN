# COVID-CT-SCAN
This Repository consists of a Deep-learning model that has been used to detect whether a person has been infected by COVID-19 or not, by examing the CT-Scan of the person.

<h3> About the Data </h3>
The Dataset used is basically a combination of 2 datasets. These 2 datasets are by far the largest 2 COVID CT-Scan Datasets available on the internet. Since there sizes are too
large, here is the link to the same.

<h3> Image Size </h3>
The Dataset consists of images of different sizes. The model has been trained and tested on 3 different image sizes, (32 X 32), (50 X 50) and (100 X 100), with the best results 
coming on the (100 X 100) image.
